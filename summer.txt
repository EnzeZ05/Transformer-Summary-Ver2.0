It was evening on Hitogashima. The sea was dyed a thin layer of orange by the setting sun.
Shinpei stood at the end of the pier, holding a rusted telescope in his hand. In the lens,
he could see the ferry slowly approaching from the distance.

“Today’s view doesn’t look any different from usual…” he muttered under his breath.

Footsteps sounded behind him. Mio came jogging over, tiny beads of sweat still on her forehead.

“Shinpei! You ran off on your own again. There’s a village meeting tonight, did you forget?”
she asked, slightly out of breath.

Shinpei didn’t turn around. He simply handed her the telescope. “See for yourself. Out there,
along the horizon.”

Mio took it and aimed at the distance. At first she saw only the outline of the ferry and a
flock of seagulls circling above it. But when she shifted her gaze a little, she suddenly
noticed an unnatural patch of darkness on the surface of the water, as if a piece of the sky
had been cut out and dropped there. The black shape was slowly moving, sending off ripples
barely visible to the naked eye.

“…Is that a shadow?” Mio’s voice trembled.

“It’s about the same place you said you saw ‘someone standing on the water’ last night,”
Shinpei finally turned to look her in the eyes. “If we don’t do anything, someone might get
hurt again tonight.”

Mio bit her lip, remembering the back of the “other her” she had seen on the path the night
before. A chill ran down her spine.

Just then, footsteps and the rustling of a plastic bag came from the other side of the pier.
Ushio walked over, munching on a rice ball from the convenience store and waving casually.
“Hey, you two, are you playing ghost stories again? The whole village is tense enough already.”

Shinpei stepped forward and snatched the other rice ball from her hand. “We’re not making
things up—the island itself is wrong. When you came up from the beach just now, didn’t the
sea breeze feel… unusually cold?”

Ushio froze for a moment, then laughed. “How could summer wind be cold? Did you stay up all
night watching horror shows again?”

Before she finished, the ferry in the distance suddenly let out a shrill horn, each blast
sharper than the last. The scattered clouds in the sky rapidly gathered, as if something were
pulling them toward the island. The three of them looked up at the same time and saw the sun
swallowed by the clouds. The shadows on the pier stretched out in an instant.

Shinpei instinctively grabbed Mio and Ushio and pulled them a step back. “Whether you believe
me or not, from now on, before it gets dark, don’t go anywhere alone.”

Mio nodded, and Ushio’s expression turned unusually serious. Wind blew in from the sea,
carrying a damp, unfamiliar smell, as if something that should never have returned was quietly
approaching the island.
